# Enhancing-Deep-Learning-Model-Robustness-Against-Adversarial-Attacks
The paper examines the VGG16 model's vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including FGSM, BIM, JSMA, and PGD, with PGD being the most effective. It also introduces an input noise-based defense mechanism that reduces attack success rates, highlighting the need for enhanced model robustness and future research.
